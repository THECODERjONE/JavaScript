//For each loop write down which values it is going to show. Then compare with the answer.

//Both loops alert same values or not?

//A: No.

let i;

//The postfix form:


for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) alert( i );

//A: 5

//The prefix form:

for (i = 0; i < 5; ++i) alert( i );

//A: 4

//WRONG. They both show 4. I should have paid more attention, it is not a thing i did not know.
