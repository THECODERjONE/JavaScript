        <!-- WRONG; didn't answer;
        The answer: first 1, then 2.
        alert( alert(1) || 2 || alert(3) );
        The call to alert does not return a value. Or, in other words, it returns undefined.

        The first OR || evaluates its left operand alert(1). That shows the first message with 1.
        The alert returns undefined, so OR goes on to the second operand searching for a truthy value.
        The second operand 2 is truthy, so the execution is halted, 2 is returned and then shown by the outer alert.
        There will be no 3, because the evaluation does not reach alert(3). -->
