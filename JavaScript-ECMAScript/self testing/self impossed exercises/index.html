        Certainly! Here are 10 exercises of increasing complexity with hints for each:

        **Exercise 1: Add Two Numbers**
        Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
        
        **Exercise 2: Find the Largest Number**
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. Hint: You can use a loop to compare each number with the largest number found so far.
        
        **Exercise 3: Reverse a String**
        Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. Hint: You can use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
        
        **Exercise 4: Calculate Factorial**
        Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Hint: Use a loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n.
        
        **Exercise 5: Palindrome Checker**
        Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Hint: Compare the characters from the beginning and end of the string inward.
        
        **Exercise 6: Title Case a Sentence**
        Write a function that takes a sentence (string) and returns a new sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized. Hint: Split the sentence into words, capitalize the first letter of each word, and join them back together.
        
        **Exercise 7: Find Missing Number**
        Write a function that finds the missing number in an array of consecutive numbers from 1 to n. Hint: Calculate the expected sum of all numbers from 1 to n and subtract the sum of the array.
        
        **Exercise 8: Caesar Cipher**
        Write a function that takes a string and a shift value and returns a new string with each letter shifted by the given value in the alphabet. Hint: Use the `charCodeAt` and `String.fromCharCode` methods to work with character codes.
        
        **Exercise 9: Count Occurrences**
        Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of each element in an array and returns the results as an object. Hint: Use an object to keep track of element counts as you iterate through the array.
        
        **Exercise 10: Search and Filter Objects**
        Write a function that looks through an array of objects and returns an array of objects that match specific name and value pairs from a source object. Hint: Use the `filter` method and `Object.keys` to compare name and value pairs in objects.
