    var instead of let
    In older scripts, you may also find another keyword: var instead of let:

    var message = 'Hello';

    The var keyword is almost the same as let. It also declares a variable, but in a slightly different, “old-school” way.

    There are subtle differences between let and var, but they do not matter for us yet. We’ll cover them in detail in the chapter The old "var".

    <!-- IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE A VALUE YOU CANT DECLARE THE VARIABLE AGAIN BUT SHOW THE NEW VALUE ONLY INSTEAD
    JUST LIKE THIS

    let message = "This";

    // repeated 'let' leads to an error
    let message = "That"; // SyntaxError: 'message' has already been declared

    SHOULD BE

    let message = "this";
    message = "that";
