// Data can be stored and accessed in many ways. You already know some common JavaScript data structures â€” arrays and objects.

// In this Basic Data Structures course, you'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects,
// and which to use in different situations. You'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access
// and manipulate data.
