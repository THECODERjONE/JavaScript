        Certainly! Here are 10 exercises of increasing complexity with hints for each:

        **Exercise 1: Add Two Numbers**
        Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
        
        **Exercise 2: Find the Largest Number**
        Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the largest number in the array. Hint: You can use a loop to compare each number with the largest number found so far.
        
        **Exercise 3: Reverse a String**
        Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed. Hint: You can use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
        
        **Exercise 4: Calculate Factorial**
        Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Hint: Use a loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n.
        
        **Exercise 5: Palindrome Checker**
        Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards). Hint: Compare the characters from the beginning and end of the string inward.
        
        **Exercise 6: Title Case a Sentence**
        Write a function that takes a sentence (string) and returns a new sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized. Hint: Split the sentence into words, capitalize the first letter of each word, and join them back together.
        
        **Exercise 7: Find Missing Number**
        Write a function that finds the missing number in an array of consecutive numbers from 1 to n. Hint: Calculate the expected sum of all numbers from 1 to n and subtract the sum of the array.
        
        **Exercise 8: Caesar Cipher**
        Write a function that takes a string and a shift value and returns a new string with each letter shifted by the given value in the alphabet. Hint: Use the `charCodeAt` and `String.fromCharCode` methods to work with character codes.
        
        **Exercise 9: Count Occurrences**
        Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of each element in an array and returns the results as an object. Hint: Use an object to keep track of element counts as you iterate through the array.
        
        **Exercise 10: Search and Filter Objects**
        Write a function that looks through an array of objects and returns an array of objects that match specific name and value pairs from a source object. Hint: Use the `filter` method and `Object.keys` to compare name and value pairs in objects.
        

        And a battery of 20 more:

        Exercise 1: Filter Positive Numbers
        Filter out positive numbers from an array of integers.

        Exercise 2: Find Maximum Value
        Find the maximum value in an array of numbers.

        Exercise 3: Remove Duplicates
        Remove duplicate elements from an array.

        Exercise 4: Filter by Property
        Given an array of objects, filter those objects that have a specific property.

        Exercise 5: Map to Another Property
        Given an array of objects, create a new array with a specific property of each object.

        Exercise 6: Object Transformation
        Transform an array of objects by adding or modifying a property.

        Exercise 7: Count Occurrences
        Count the number of occurrences of each element in an array and return the results as an object.

        Exercise 8: Find Object by Property Value
        Given an array of objects, find an object with a specific property value.

        Exercise 9: Merge Objects
        Merge multiple objects into a single object.

        Exercise 10: Filter Object by Multiple Properties
        Given an array of objects, filter objects that match multiple property conditions.

        Exercise 11: Group by Property
        Group an array of objects by a specific property into an object where keys are property values.

        Exercise 12: Calculate Average Property Value
        Calculate the average value of a specific property in an array of objects.

        Exercise 13: Object Sorting
        Sort an array of objects based on a specific property.

        Exercise 14: Flatten Nested Objects
        Flatten a nested object into a single-level object.

        Exercise 15: Search and Replace Property
        Search for objects with a specific property value and replace it with a new value.

        Exercise 16: Deep Copy an Object
        Create a deep copy of a nested object.

        Exercise 17: Object Validation
        Validate objects based on specific criteria and filter out invalid ones.

        Exercise 18: Calculate Object Property Sum
        Calculate the sum of a specific property in an array of objects.

        Exercise 19: Nested Object Mapping
        Map properties of a nested object into a new structure.

        Exercise 20: Advanced Object Manipulation
        Perform a complex operation on an array of objects, involving filtering, mapping, and merging based on multiple conditions.
