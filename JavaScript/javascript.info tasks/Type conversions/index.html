        // What are results of these expressions?
        "" + 1 + 0      // 10
        "" - 1 + 0      // -10 WRONG; it actually is -1, since the operator "-" only works with numbers so "undefined" becomes 0
        true + false    // true; 1 WRONG; just 1, since its math operation
        6 / "3"         // 6 WRONG; string 3 is converted to number 3 by the operator /
        "2" * "3"       // 6
        4 + 5 + "px"    // 9px
        "$" + 4 + 5     // $45
        "4" - 2         // 2
        "4px" - 2       // NaN
        "  -9  " + 5    // "  -9  5"
        "  -9  " - 5    // no answer WRONG; as "-" forces the string to number then it becomes -9-5
        null + 1        // 1
        undefined + 1   // NaN
        " \t \n" - 2    // no asnwer WRONG; \t and \n are space character just like "regular" spaces in html, so they are just spaces for the code, making the string empty
